- document
- vars; .stamp & .frm delta file finding to log
- multi support or config arg
- example simple 2-weekly full + daily incrmental crontab
- better/cleaner handling of rotation variables
- restore logic, e.g:
  dbbak list
  restore full.prev.3
- theoretically, innobackupex can handle incrementals if only a single
  most recent incremental is available in storage; current logic checks
  for the initial full backup and so may be too strict in some cases.
  incremental should handle these cases, although this could have a bearing
  on rotation logic, etc...
